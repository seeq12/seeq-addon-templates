# SDK Resources

Pulled from http://localhost:34216; version R66.0.0-SNAPSHOT

 - /api/plugins/sdk/seeq.d.ts
 - /api/plugins/sdk/seeq.js
 - /api/plugins/sdk/seeq.css

These files were retrieved from a Seeq Server for TypeScript typechecking and
for reference. Plugins should not bundle these resources, but should instead
reference them at runtime.

The plugin may work on different versions of Seeq, but only one versions types
will be checked.
